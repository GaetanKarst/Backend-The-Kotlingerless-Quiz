## Introduction

This repository consists of the backend of the Kotlingerless Quiz project containing the API and the database. It is a very barebone backend made as a learning experience on how to make an entire backend in Kotlin.

The Kotlingerless Quiz is a simple quiz made using Kotlin and android API. Players have to go through a series of questions in order to score points.
At the end of the quiz, is displayed the total score of the current players along with a scoreboard of players' scores stored in a database.
